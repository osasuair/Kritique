## About
Imagine a world where you never again fall victim to a scam website, waste time on a frustrating platform, or miss out on hidden gems online. This is the world Kritique is building.

Kritique is not just another review site. It's a revolutionary platform that leverages the power of AI to transform how we understand and interact with the digital world.

Inspired by the need for honest, accessible, and concise reviews, Kritique reimagines the online review experience.

## Features

*   **Enhanced Trust and Transparency:** Kritique prioritizes authenticity and combats fake reviews through AI-powered verification and user reputation systems, ensuring you can trust the information you find.
*   **Community-Driven Improvement:** Kritique empowers users to contribute to a safer online environment by reporting suspicious websites and sharing their experiences.

Kritique is more than just a review site; it's a movement towards a more transparent and trustworthy internet.
